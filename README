Zach's Vending Machine
======================
This program simulates a vending machine and simulates the features of the Vending Machine Kata.
There are a few ways to run this project but the preferred way is to use a Maven command as it will run through all the
unit test and then compile an executable jar file. If you have Maven installed run the following on command line:
mvn clean install
After running this command, you will need to run the compiled program. Use the follow command to run the jar:
java -jar /target/VendingMachine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [exactChange] [(<colaStock> <chipsStock> <candyStock)]
where exactChange is if you want the machine to only take exact change and the stock arguments are integer amounts
of each product the machine will have on startup. Note: if you give stock to one product, you must give an amount to all

If you don't have Maven accessible on your machine, I've provided the already compiled jar file for the project.
To run the jar simply remove the /target from the command so that it looks like this:
java -jar /VendingMachine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [exactChange] [(<colaStock> <chipsStock> <candyStock)]
